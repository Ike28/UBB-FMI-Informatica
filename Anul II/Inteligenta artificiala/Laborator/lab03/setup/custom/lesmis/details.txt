The file lesmis.gml contains the weighted network of co-appearances of
characters in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Miserables".  Nodes represent
characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of
characters that appear in the same chapter of the book.  The values on the
edges are the number of such co-appearances.  The data on co-appearances were
taken from D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for
Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).
