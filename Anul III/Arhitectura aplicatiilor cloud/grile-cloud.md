- [x] ___Custom built OpenID Connect systems___
<br>

#### 16. The relationship between TLS and SSL is:

- [ ] TLS handles communication while SSL handles identity verification
- [ ] They are not related
- [x] ___TLS is the successor of SSL___
<br>

#### 17. Which of the following is the availability formula used in cloud environments?

- [x] ___When you don't have to setup any infrastructure___
- [x] ___When you don't have to provision capacity___
<br>

#### 20. A resilient system is one that is:
- [x] ___predictable___

- [ ] self managed
- [x] ___self healing___
- [x] ___adaptive___
<br>

#### 21. Asymmetric encryption is suited for:

- [x] ___Digital signatures (identity verification)___
- [ ] High-performance compute
- [ ] Large payloads
<br>

#### 22. In which case is a streaming service more suitable than a queue?
- [ ] When we want to reduce the load on the clients
- [x] ___When we might want to replay previous messages/events___
